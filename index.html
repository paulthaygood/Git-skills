    <h1>Paul Haygood</h1>
    <p>I'm from Columbia, SC and I've recently moved to Charleston. Before coming to TIY I worked in customer service and compliance for Palmetto State Armory. I'm interested in web development and freelance coding so that I can be my own boss and create something meaningful!</p>
    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Ruby, REACT, and probably others that I don't even know about.</p>
